# Lie Group Machine Learning

## Introduction

This is an auxilliary lib for my final year project, which aims to create a working high performance tensor-based implementation of Lie structure theory. The goal of the whole project is to design an learning algorithm based on structure theory of Lie algebra.

## Basic

Contains basic definition and operation for Lie algebra.
