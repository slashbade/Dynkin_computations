# Lie Group Machine Learning

## Introduction

This is an auxiliary library for my final year project, aiming to create a tensor-based implementation of structure theory Lie algebra. Main goal of this project is to realize the Dynkin classification given the structure constants of a semisimple Lie algebra.

## Basic

Contains basic definition and operation for Lie algebra.
